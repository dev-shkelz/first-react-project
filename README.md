# Project Title and Description:

Project Title `first-react-app`
Description: A mini-project where you can SignUp and LogIn to Add or Delete posts,
and use the Demo-App, which is a youtube URL converter.

## Installation Instructions:

Step-by-step instructions on how you can install my project,
including any dependencies that need to be installed separately:

1. create react app 'first-react-app'
2. npm install react-router-dom
3. npm install react-hook-form
4. npm install react-youtube

## Usage:

Start the application: `npm run start`

## Folder Structure:

In the `components` folder are the components of the `pages` folder.
The components of e.g. `Home.js` are placed in the folder `home-comp`.
`home-comp` can have other sub-folders like `hero`, `posts`, etc.
So to make it clear, if a folder inside `components` is named say `example-comp`,
it means that the components that are inside of it, belong to the page `Example.js`.
On the other side, if the folder inside `components` is missing `-comp`
or has another name, it means that those components can be used globally(e.g. Modal).

Other folders like `hooks`, `context`, and `theme`, hold functionality based on their names.

Mention: Only `Navbar` and `Footer` are placed in the `pages` folder,
although they aren't pages.

About CSS:

1. CSS of `App.js` -div and the `Home.js`, `About.js` and `Contact.js` divs are placed in `App.css`.
   (Hint: Only the wrapper divs).

2. CSS of `Navbar.js` and `Footer.js` is placed in `index.css`.
   `index.css` also holds all the global classes.

3. CSS of `components` is placed inside the `components` folder,
   where each `sub-folder` has its specific CSS file.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
